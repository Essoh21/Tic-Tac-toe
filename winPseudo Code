  Let conquer  recognizing a win 
  
     a win occure when :
           - three os in a raw or a column 
           - three xs in a raw or a column 
           - three xs in a diagonal 
           - three os in a diagonal 
           
     raws   
         123  ------    +1
         456
         789
      columns
           147 ----------- +3
           258
           369
      diagonals  
             159      ---------- +4
             357    ------------  +2
             
        Devide and concquer 
        
        LOOK AT EACH ROW, COLUMN AND DIAGONAL AFTER EACH PLAYüòÇÔ∏è
        if one of the is ooo  winner  is second player 
        if one of them is xxx winner is firstPlayer 
        
       Concquer identify a win row  and a win column 
          
          create a function that take row cells values and  concatenate letters and return a word 
          apply that function to rows and columns and diagonals in order to identify a win ;
          
          
        Pseudo code of  the function that concate  done 
        
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
       goal : a function to look at each row, column and diagonal   DONE 
       
   pseudo code :
           create three arrays rowsStart columnStart and diagSatart 
           
         columnStart  contain 0,1,2
         rowsStart contain 0, 3, 6
         diagStart contains 0, 2  
      loop through these arrays and collect their plays and store them in new arrays (3 arrays row plays, column plays and diagPlays )  DONE 
      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           GOAL:  identify a win and target wining  cells 
           
    
                   
            write a function that look at plays (checkWin()) and identify a win  and return true if there is a win and false if not.   DONE
            
            write a function (checkWinDirection())that identify  the winning cells location if there is a win and return the column row or diag   DONE 
            
           write a function (checkWinner()) that identify the winner when a win occure.     Done 
           
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Goal:  target winning cells 
   
   write a function (getWinningCells())  that return winning cells indexs when a win occure
   
   write a function (checkWinnigPlay()) that return the winning play   DONE
   
    Pseudo Code of getWinnigCells  :
       if a win occure 
          get winning play and checkWinDirection 
          look at the index of the winning play in winDirection
